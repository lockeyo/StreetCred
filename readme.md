# StreetCred @ BCG DV Hacks: Mobility

StreetCred was created during the BCG DV Hacks: Mobility in Manhattan Beach, CA. Our product aims to reduce our collective carbon footprint by using the latest technology and research in the fields of artificial intelligence, psychology, and human compuer interaction.

## Mission

We aim to tackle two of the world's most pressing mobility challenges: climate change and urbanization.

## We are

We are a team of three interdisciplinary people building products with the potential to have real immediate impact on the environment. Our team has worked at companies like Porsche, Microsoft, Shopify and fast growing startups across Europe and the US.

## The idea

StreetCred is a gamified platform for companies and cities to reward members for prioritizing sustainability when making personal transportation decisions.

We use AI-powered transportation mode classification and gamification to incentivize solo drivers to improve their mobility habits and reduce their carbon footprints. We offer companies a way to reduce parking costs and create happier, healthier employees.
